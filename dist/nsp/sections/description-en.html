Vocabulary for describing the places, locations and names of Norman Sicily that are available through The Norman Sicily Project site, http://www.normansicily.org/.
There are three primary classes: Place, Location and Name. Place is the central class and describes a place which we know of because of a recorded reference.
That place may or may not have a physical location on the Earth's surface, which is described using the Location class. Both Locations and Places may have several Names which refer to them.
